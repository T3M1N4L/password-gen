# Password Generator & Strength Tester

> This was a really fun project to make, the overall usefulness of password generators are far less superior than passphrase generators, which I frogot existed. So if I come back to this project, that is what I would implement.

A feature-rich password generator and strength tester built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI**. This tool allows users to create secure passwords while providing instant feedback on their strength.
